# sanstephen_coffee
### A coffee review website made in python with the django framework.

Me and my partner enjoy going to new cafes and trying new coffees, so I created a website to keep track of our ratings. It is able to store ratings for different cafes and plot them on a map in order to keep track of the best cafes we visit.
